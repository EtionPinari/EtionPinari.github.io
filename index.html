			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Etion Pinari, a BSc graduate in <a href="https://www.polimi.it/" target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>, in the field of Computer Engineering, currently studying in the masters level (MSc). <br>
				Proficient in Italian (B2 certified CELI), English (C1 certified TOEFL) and Albanian (mother language) I consider myself a person who you can speak freely to. <br><br>
				I have had the pleasure of becoming experienced in many programming languages such as those of web design, data sciences, OOP, logical and electronical modelling.<br>
				My interests in the work field consist of videogame design and software engineering. In my free time I tend to read books about managment and design, work out, practice playing the piano, but mostly study for the exams.<br><br>
				This is a small project so that I can get used to HTML, CSS and Javascript coding.
