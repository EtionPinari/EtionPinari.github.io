		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Etion Pinari, a graduand in <a href="https://www.polimi.it/" target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>, in the field of Computer Engineering BSc. <br>
			Proficient in Italian (B2 certified CELI), English (C1 certified TOEFL) and Albanian (mother language) I consider myself a person who you can speak freely to. <br><br>
			I have experience with the programming languages of C, Java, SQL, VHDL, C# and as of lately  HTML and CSS. <br>
			My interests in the work field consist of videogame design and software engineering. In my free time I tend to read books about managment and design, work out, practice playing the piano, but mostly study for the exams.<br><br>
			This is a small project so that I can get used to HTML and CSS "coding". 
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find my LinkedIn or my gitHub repository by pressing the button on the top right.
