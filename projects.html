				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>
					During the course of these three years in BSc I have had to take part in many mini-projects, be them in a group or singularly.<br>
					The most important ones of these projects can be found in my gitHub repositories.  <br>
				</p>
				<h2>
					General description of the projects
				</h2>
				<p>
					<ul class = "proj-description">
						<li>
							Online board game "Santorini" (Java)
						</li>
						<p>
							As one of the last projects of bachelors degree we had to recreate a pre-existing game called 
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIJs0k-1ync">Santorini</a> in which people take turns to move their workers and 
							build different levels of buildings. All this with the purpose of climbing up to the third floor of a building as to win at the game.<br>
							The game was created with the help of my dear friends 
							<a href="https://github.com/FraLeone837" target = "_blank">Francesco Leone</a>
							 and 
							<a href="https://github.com/simonelemmapolimi" target="_blank">Simone Lemma</a>, and is playable both in CLI-mode (Command Line Input) and GUI (Graphical User Interface).
							This was one of the most enjoyable projects that I have been part of.<br>
							Below is shown some screenshots of the game. In-order from left to right (GUI) :<br> 1- The game connection,      2- Input request to choose worker,     3- Input request to move the worker.

						<li>
							Fast database-search algorithm (C)
						</li>
						<p>
							The request was to store-delete and search accounts, and relationships between these accounts, with certain criterias (such as accounts with highest number of friends) in a timely manner. This individual project showed students why time-complexity and space in memory are highly important topics to tackle every time you build an algorithm. 
							<br> The abstract data types I implemented to save all the information and get it back in as little time as possible were: "separate chaining hash-tables" to store the names of accounts as well as <tag class = "rb"> red</tag> and <tag class = "br"> black </tag> trees for the information of the numbers of relationships.

						</p>
						<li>
							Electronic fast codifier with Working-Zone Protocol (VHDL)
						</li>
						<p>
							Based on the 
							<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3336995_Working-zone_encoding_for_reducing_the_energy_in_microprocessor_address_buses">Working-Zone Encoding Protocol</a>, which saves on energy-consumption on microcomponents, we had to code the electronic part which would take care of the encoding. This is all described with great detail in <a href="https://github.com/EtionPinari/10619348_RL_proj" target="_blank">my VHDL repository</a> although it is only in Italian. <br>
							For a brief description of how it worked, I implemented an FSM <tag class = "small">(finite state machine)</tag> which would request from the RAM-memory the data in all the adresses, and would then find if the data belonged to one of the Working-Zones or not, flagging it to the RAM and storing it as well.
